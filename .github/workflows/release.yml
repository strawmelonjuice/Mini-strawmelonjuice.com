            This is a new release of Cynthia Mini Website Engine.

            ### Installing Cynthia Mini

            There are two officially supported methods of installing Cynthia Mini.

            #### With Bun (recommended method)

            If you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed, you can install Cynthia Mini by just running:

            ```sh
            bun install -g @cynthiaweb/cynthiaweb-mini@${{ github.ref_name }}
            ```
            Note: All releases, including pre-releases, are tagged `latest` on the npm registry. Use a specific version tag if you want to install.

            This installs this release from NPM.

            #### With binary installer script (installs the binaries found below)

            If you prefer not to use Bun, or can't use it to install, you can also use these binary install scripts:

            ##### For Linux and MacOS

            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cynthiawebsiteengine.github.io/Mini-docs/assets/install.sh | bash
            ```

            ##### For Windows

            ```powershell
            powershell -c "irm https://cynthiawebsiteengine.github.io/Mini-docs/assets/install.ps1 | iex"
            ```

            This removes the need for Bun, but the cynthiaweb-mini CLI will be quite a big bigger in file size.

            *You can obviously also install it manually by downloading the binaries below.*

            See <https://cynthiawebsiteengine.github.io/Mini-docs/#/install> for more information.
