//// Configurable variables module
////
//// This module doesn't exist to hold any actual types for configurable variables,
//// as that is implemented in `cynthia_websites_mini_client/configtype`. Also not
//// Providing any fucntions for reading, serialising etc. those functions are implemented
//// in their relative `cynthia_websites_mini_server` and `cynthia_websites_mini_client` modules.
////
//// However, these variables are dynamically marked and not typestrongly shipped to the client-side.
//// This compromises the guarantee of Gleams type safety mechanisms, and might create errors on users'
//// ends without any valid way of reproducing. This also makes it very hard to do certain optimisations
////
//// Luckily, those dynamic markers are developed by yours truly, and of course I keep type information with them.
//// Even though some values might still be arbitrarily typed and left unchecked, types you add to the below
//// const typecontrolled variable, WILL be checked in runtime.
////
//// Please note: variables in the model are stored under the 'other' type, which means you'll have to decode their values
//// once more after transfer. However, by setting types beforehand you'll be able to directly decode them, instead of first having to decode them to a
//// `List(String)` and then manually having to convert their type.

/// Variable names and their pre-defined types.
